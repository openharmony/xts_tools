# Design Issues Report — §16.5.6 Additional Entities (Concurrent Container)

## Identified Issues

### 1. Stdlib Dependency (Additional Entities (Concurrent Container))
- **Issue**: Additional Entities (Concurrent Container) relies on the underlying standard library (libc/libstdc++/libc++).
- **Status**: The platform's stdlib implementation may not yet provide stable async-aware additional entities (concurrent container) primitives.
- **Impact**: Tests validate only declaration/compile-time behavior. Runtime behavior cannot be verified without stdlib support.

### 2. Missing Runtime Tests
- **Type**: Functional / Integration
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Description**: No runtime test exists under the `runtime/` directory.
- **Impact**: Async lock/unlock, contention, and timeout scenarios are untested.

## Recommendations
1. Implement runtime tests once stdlib provides async-aware synchronization primitives.
2. Add stress tests for concurrent access patterns.
3. Verify cross-platform stdlib compatibility (Linux / Windows / macOS).
