## 1. Overview -- Three-Language Positioning for Final Classes

Final classes are a conservative language feature that allows a class author to explicitly prohibit inheritance. All three languages -- ArkTS, Java, and Swift -- support `final` at the class level with **identical semantics**:

| Aspect | ArkTS | Java | Swift |
|--------|-------|------|-------|
| Keyword | `final class` | `final class` | `final class` |
| Meaning | Class cannot be extended | Class cannot be subclassed | Class cannot be subclassed |
| Purpose | Prevent unintended inheritance; enable compiler optimizations; enforce design intent | Same | Same |
| Interface/Protocol | A final class can implement interfaces | A final class can implement interfaces | A final class can conform to protocols |

All three languages use `final` as a **modifier** placed before the `class` keyword. The semantics are conservative: final removes the ability to extend, but does not restrict instantiation, interface implementation, or type usage.

## 3. Key Difference Matrix

### 3.1 Capability Comparison

| Capability | ArkTS | Java | Swift |
|-----------|-------|------|-------|
| **Final class declaration** | `final class C { }` | `final class C { }` | `final class C { }` |
| **Syntax position** | Modifier before `class` keyword | Modifier before `class` keyword | Modifier before `class` keyword |
| **Method override prevention** | `final` on method; or all methods in final class | `final` on method; or all methods in final class | `final` on func; or all methods in final class |
| **Interface implementation** | Allowed for final classes | Allowed for final classes | Allowed for final classes (protocol conformance) |
| **Abstract combination** | Not allowed (final + abstract conflict) | Not allowed (final + abstract conflict) | Not allowed (final + required override conflict) |
| **Runtime effect** | None (pure compile-time check) | None (pure compile-time check) | May enable devirtualization optimizations |
| **Error code / message** | ESE0178: "Cannot inherit with 'final' modifier." | "cannot inherit from final X" | "inheritance from a final class 'X'" |

### 3.2 Identical Behaviors

The following behaviors are **identical** across all three languages:

1. A class marked `final` cannot appear after `extends` / `:` in a subclass declaration.
2. A final class can implement any number of interfaces / protocols.
3. A final class can be freely instantiated, passed as an argument, and used as a type.
4. Methods inside a final class cannot be overridden (trivially, because no subclass can exist).
5. The `final` modifier on an individual method in a non-final class prevents that specific method from being overridden in subclasses.

### 3.3 Minor Differences

| Difference | ArkTS | Java | Swift |
|-----------|-------|------|-------|
| Error code system | Numeric ESE codes (ESE0178, ESE1324203, ESE0136) | Compiler-specific error messages (localized) | Compiler-specific error messages (English) |
| Multiple error reporting | ESE1324203 + ESE0136 emitted together | Single error message | Single error message |
| Final + abstract mutual exclusion | Compile error (spec-defined) | Compile error (JLS-defined) | Compile error (language guide-defined) |
| Final for performance | Not specified | JIT may use for devirtualization | Compiler may use for devirtualization |

### Error Message Comparison

| Scenario | ArkTS | Java | Swift |
|----------|-------|------|-------|
| Extending final class | `ESE0178: Cannot inherit with 'final' modifier.` | `无法从最终FinalClassJava进行继承` (cannot inherit from final FinalClassJava) | `inheritance from a final class 'FinalClassSwift'` |
| Overriding final method | `ESE1324203: Class member X cannot override X because the overridden method is final.` + `ESE0136: Method X not overriding any method` | `被覆盖的方法为final` (overridden method is final) | `instance method overrides a 'final' instance method` |

Although the error **wording** differs across languages, the **behavior** is identical: all three languages reject the program at compile time.

## 6. Comprehensive Scoring

Scoring is based on feature completeness, correctness, cross-language consistency, and documentation quality. Stars range from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent).

| Dimension | ArkTS | Java | Swift | Notes |
|-----------|-------|------|-------|-------|
| **Feature Completeness** | 5/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | All three support final class, final method, interface implementation |
| **Correctness** | 5/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | No false positives or false negatives observed |
| **Error Message Clarity** | 4/5 | 4/5 | 5/5 | ArkTS uses numeric codes; Java uses localized text; Swift uses clear English |
| **Cross-Language Consistency** | 5/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | Semantics are 100% identical across all three |
| **Documentation Coverage** | 4/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | ArkTS spec is clear; Java JLS is exhaustive; Swift guide is accessible |
| **Overall** | **4.6/5** | **4.8/5** | **5.0/5** | Swift leads slightly on error message quality |

## 7. Core Conclusions

1. **Semantic Identity:** ArkTS, Java, and Swift implement final class semantics in a manner that is functionally identical. All three languages use `final` to prevent class inheritance, method overriding, and to enforce immutability-by-design in class hierarchies.

2. **No Cross-Language Divergence:** None of the cross-language tests revealed any behavioral divergence. Final class inheritance prohibition, final method override prohibition, and interface/protocol implementation by final classes work identically across all three languages.

3. **Compile-Time Enforcement:** All three languages enforce final restrictions at compile time. There are no runtime checks involved -- the compiler rejects invalid programs before execution.

4. **Error Message Variation:** The only observable difference across languages is the wording and structure of error messages. ArkTS uses numeric error codes (ESE0178, ESE1324203), Java uses localized compiler messages, and Swift uses clear English descriptions. None of these differences affect the actual program semantics.

5. **ArkTS Alignment with Industry Standard:** ArkTS's final class design is fully aligned with the established semantics in Java (since Java 1.0) and Swift (since Swift 1.0). Developers familiar with either Java or Swift will find ArkTS final classes immediately intuitive.

## 8. ArkTS Design Recommendations

Based on the cross-language comparison, the following recommendations are offered for ArkTS's final class implementation:

### 8.1 Maintain Current Semantics (No Change Needed)

ArkTS's final class semantics are correct and consistent with both Java and Swift. No semantic changes are recommended.

### 8.2 Error Message Enhancement (Minor)

Consider adding a secondary hint to ESE0178 that mentions the specific final class name that is being extended, similar to Java and Swift:

- **Current:** `ESE0178: Cannot inherit with 'final' modifier.`
- **Suggested:** `ESE0178: Cannot inherit from 'ClassName' because it is declared 'final'.`

This would make the error more self-diagnostic, especially in complex codebases where the final declaration may be in a different file.

### 8.3 Consider Combined Error for Override (Minor)

When a non-final class attempts to override a final method from a parent, ArkTS currently emits two errors (ESE1324203 + ESE0136). Consider whether a single more descriptive error would be clearer, or keep both for explicitness (the dual-error approach has the advantage of explaining both "what" and "why").

### 8.4 Documentation Addition

Consider adding a non-normative note in the ArkTS specification that explicitly states the alignment with Java and Swift final class semantics, to aid developers transitioning from those languages:

> "Note: ArkTS final classes follow the same semantics as Java's final classes (JLS 8.1.1.2) and Swift's final classes. A class declared final cannot be used as a superclass."

### 8.5 Final + Abstract Guard (If Not Already Present)

Ensure that declaring a class as both `final` and `abstract` is explicitly rejected with a clear compile-time error, as both Java and Swift enforce this mutual exclusion. (This is a logical impossibility -- final means "cannot be extended", abstract means "must be extended".)
